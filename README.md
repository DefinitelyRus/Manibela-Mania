## What’s This Game About?
Manibela Mania is a simulation game that puts you in the driver’s seat of a traditional jeepney as you navigate the vibrant streets. 
Set on a main road, the game immerses you in an urban environment filled with everyday commuters. But the real challenge isn’t just about driving — it’s keeping the spirit alive: guiding passengers safely, managing fares with honesty to reach your daily quota, and embodying the quiet acts of service that define a true Filipino driver.
Drive straight ahead, managing your speed and stops to keep the passengers safe and the ride smooth. Every stop is a chance to serve with pride and carry the city’s spirit forward.
